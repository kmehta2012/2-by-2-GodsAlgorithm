"""
This script is an implementation of all the legal moves that can be done on a 3 * 3 * 3 cube.
The standard singmaster notation will be used to describe the moves. 

I'm going to assume that the cube is oriented white side up with the orange side on the left of white and red on the right.

Standard moves that I'm going to implement:
F (front), B (back), R (right), L (left), D (down), U (up), M, E, S 
and their opposite directoins

Standard moves that I'm going to ignore:
1. Changing the orientation of the cube : x,y,z (I'm assuming a fixed orientation)
2. Wide moves : Turning two slices at the same time (will be implemented as one slice at a time)
